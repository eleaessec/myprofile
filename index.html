        <h2> My relationship with Nature </h2>
        <p>
          This might seems weird, but this is really something I care about: being nature-friendly. I went in a horsing Sport Study School when I was 14: we lived in the same building as the horses, in the middle of nowhere, just fields, animals, and all the Nature's resources. We were not riding our horses but creating a relationship with them so we could work with them freely. This year, I had a click: I want to be Mother Nature's partner. So since then, i don't eat meat, I make my lifestyle as eco-friendly as possible, and I really try to be in connexion with nature as much as possible.

        <h2>My sports üèãÔ∏è‚Äç</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a super sporty girl: I did horse riding, swimming, volley-ball, swimming, I went to the gym (before covid...). I am hyperactive so to me, exercizing is a need and really helps me releasing my energy.

        <h2>Astrology ‚ôçÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Taurus, ascendant Taurus: without surprise, I am hell of a stubborn girl, full of energy, who takes any opportunities and radiant with good energies. These trait can sometimes makes me take decisions and think about the consequences after, but at least, I'm trying everything !

        <h2>Discovering the world ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          Travelling is one of my greatest passion: I went to so much countries ! USA, Iceland, Bali, Thailand, Turkey, Tunisia, Swiss, Italy, Spain, Canaries Islands, UK, and of course Taiwan, since I am half French half Taiwanese. I enjoy so much discovering new cultures, I deeply think that an immersion in other people is one of the best way to open your mind to the fullness of our wonderful planet.

        <h2>My internship üìö</h2>
        <p>
         I found my internship at Station F, the greatest Startup Incubator in France. I will work in Creative Valley's team. I can't wait to move from theory to practice by applying everything I have learned this year. 
         Professionnally, this is my anthem: "Mettre mes talents et ma cr√©ativit√© au service de votre univers pour le voir grandir, et grandir √† mon tour"
